Odoo Custom Scaffold Script

This is my personal scaffold command that I use to create a new Odoo app/module. I have no interest in you finding it helpful, as I don't care about you anyway. However, here are some reasons why you should consider using it yourself:

- I often run the Odoo scaffold command and then delete a lot of unwanted stuff. Why the F would I want to create them in the first place?

- Now I have to go and delete all the imports of unwanted stuff because someone thought it was a good idea to add the demo folder in a scaffold command because it's a very common use case, right?!

Anyway, I will not tell you how to use it because it's so obvious. Simply run `python scaffold.py` and figure it out yourself."
